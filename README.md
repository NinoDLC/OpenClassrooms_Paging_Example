# OpenClassrooms_Paging_Example
Paging doesn't have to be hard! It's quite simple with Flows and a sensible split of responsibilities.

# Branches
`master` is the base, simple branch. You should start here for a quick view of a way to do pagination with Flows.  
`moar` is more complex, because it handles errors, retries, end of pagination, etc. For a better representation of a professional code, you should check there.
